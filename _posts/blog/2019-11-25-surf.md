Even though the water was always freezing (literally only few degrees celsius) the surf in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ was amazing! I really fell in love with the landscape between Tofino and Ucluelet. 

Together with my partner I tried all sorts of options to get into the waves ðŸŒŠ. I started by taking a lesson at the new spot.

With an experienced friend visiting, we booked boards and the warmest Neo to get into the waves ourselves.

Completely different was the trip with VIU recreation, the university outdoor association. During this trip, everything was organised, which made it really enjoyable. Having a group of nice people and some amazing instructors made the experience perfect.
