I have been hooked on foils for a while now. Last year I did my first Wing foiling course and knew that I need one afterwards. After my bumpy start in Munich, I felt like this vacation semester would be the perfect opportunity for me to get one. After my last exam I assembled everything and got to the water a few days later with two friends.

Everyone fell into the water at some point.

But both of them surfed, sailed and kited before, so they were very experienced and got on the foil on the first few attempts.
